Key Features 

Proposal
The consensus system allows users to submit a proposal to be voted on. Alongside the proposal, the voting options can also be submitted so that votes are cast towards a specific option. The proposal also has an expiry time so that voting opens and closes appropriately. This also prompts users to cast their votes within the timeframe to reach a decision. The submitter can also put a description of the proposal and provide any additional information needed. This mimics typical voting in real life such as for the election day of governmental elections. The proposal system can be beneficial to allow clear decisions to be made in an efficient manner representative of the members' opinion without the need to hours of boardroom discussions.  

Voting
The system allows users to log in and view all proposals and cast their votes for each proposal. The users can vote on the proposals by selecting any of the options provided for the proposal. The votes must be cast within the timeframe before the proposal expires. The voting is anonymous so members cannot see the specific option selected by other, only the total number of votes for each option.  

Accounts
The consensus system requires the registration of all users with a valid MetaMask wallet. This extra privacy ensures only concerned users can access the system. The need for a MetaMask wallet also adds a layer of protection from bots who may spam the system. The need to register for the account also can help users keep track of current proposals and previous votes all in one place. The account for each user is also part of the user experience and adds to the feeling of membership and ownership which could motivate the user to engage in voting.  

Dark & Light Mode
The system features both light and dark modes as part of the user interface. This can be ergonomic as it promotes efficiency and comfort for users. This is also an accessible solution as some users require a certain lighting condition due to visual abilities and impairments. The dark and light mode settings enhance the user experience of the system promoting user engagement which will carry over to the voter engagement.
